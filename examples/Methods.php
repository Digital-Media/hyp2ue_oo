 * Method declarations are similar to function declarations, but need a public, protected or private keyword in front
 * Methods are declared within a class declaration. Functions are declared outside a class declaration
 * This class is the only oophp example that fulfills the requirements of PSR-1 and causes no side-effects
 *
 * MUST be called by call_methods.php!!! Otherwise you see a white screen in the browser. No errors are given.
